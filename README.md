## 🚀 Key Features

- **Digital Twin Integration** — Agent based adaptive digital twin.
- **MDP-based Formulation** — Sensor movement modeled as a sequential decision process.
- **Rainbow DQN Agent** — Uses distributional RL for risk-aware decision-making.
- **Information-Theoretic Reward** — Maximizes determinant of the FIM for informative sensor placement.
- **Spatial Correlation-Aware** — Rewards spatially well-distributed sensor configurations.
- **Case Studies** — Applied to a cantilever plate under damage severity and localization scenarios.
